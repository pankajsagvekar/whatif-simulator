# Design Document

## Overview

The AI What If Simulator is designed as a modular system that processes user scenarios through two distinct analysis pipelines: a serious outcome generator focused on realistic cause-and-effect reasoning, and a creative outcome generator that produces humorous or surreal interpretations. The system leverages AI language models to generate contextually appropriate responses while maintaining clear separation between the two output types.

## Architecture

The system follows a pipeline architecture with an enhanced presentation layer featuring split-screen UI and animation system:

```

### Core Components

1. **Input Handler**: Receives and validates user "What if..." scenarios with animated interactions

5. **Split-Screen Presenter**: Manages dual-panel layout and coordinated animations
6. **Panel Controllers**: Handle individual panel behavior and styling
7. **Animation Engine**: Orchestrates all UI animations and interactive effects

## UI/UX Design

### Split-Screen Layout Architecture

The interface uses a responsive split-screen design that emphasizes the duality between serious and fun outcomes:

#### Layout Structure
- **Left Panel (Serious)**: Professional styling with calm colors, subtle shadows, and glowing borders
- **Right Panel (Fun)**: Vibrant styling with dynamic gradients, playful borders, and animated backgrounds
- **Input Section**: Centered above panels with animated placeholder text and interactive submit button
- **Theme Toggle**: Positioned for easy access with smooth sun-moon morphing animation

#### Animation System

**Entrance Animations:**
- Serious Panel: Smooth fade-in with gentle slide from left, professional glow effect
- Fun Panel: Playful spin or wiggle entrance with bounce effect and color transitions
- Coordinated timing ensures both panels appear simultaneously but with distinct personalities

**Interactive Animations:**
- Hover Effects: Parallax tilt on both panels with different intensities
- Submit Button: Bounce on hover, confetti explosion on click
- Loading States: Thinking emoji bounce or typing robot animation
- Confetti System: Emoji confetti triggered on fun panel result display

**Theme Transitions:**
- Dark/Light Toggle: Smooth sun-moon morphing with color palette transitions
- Panel styling adapts while maintaining personality distinction

### Responsive Design Considerations

- **Desktop**: Full split-screen with side-by-side panels
- **Tablet**: Stacked panels with maintained animation effects
- **Mobile**: Single column with swipe navigation between serious/fun views

### Accessibility Features

- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels for panel distinction
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure readability in both light and dark themes

## Error Handling

### Input Validation Errors
- Empty or null input: Prompt for valid scenario
- Inappropriate content: Request alternative phrasing
- Too vague scenarios: Ask for clarification while providing best-effort analysis

### Processing Errors
- AI generation failures: Retry with simplified prompts
- Timeout scenarios: Provide partial results with explanation
- Content filtering issues: Generate alternative approaches

### Fallback Strategies
- If serious generation fails: Provide structured analysis framework
- If fun generation fails: Offer creative prompts or examples
- If both fail: Provide scenario analysis template for user completion

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Input validation with various scenario types
- Individual outcome generator testing with known inputs
- Output formatting verification
- Error handling for edge cases

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end scenario processing pipeline
- AI model integration and response quality
- Performance testing with various input complexities
- Content appropriateness validation

### User Acceptance Testing
- Scenario variety testing (personal, professional, historical)
- Output quality assessment for both serious and fun versions
- User experience flow validation
- Response time and system reliability testing

## Implementation Considerations

### AI Model Integration
- Use structured prompts to ensure consistent output quality
- Implement prompt engineering for distinct serious vs. fun personalities

### UI/Animation Performance
- Use CSS transforms and GPU acceleration for smooth animations

- Use CSS feature detection for advanced animations
- Ensure consistent experience across devices

### Scalability
