# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI What If Simulator is a feature that takes user-provided "What if..." questions and generates two distinct alternate outcomes: a realistic, cause-and-effect analysis and a humorous, exaggerated or surreal interpretation. This feature aims to provide both practical insight and entertainment value by exploring scenarios from multiple creative perspectives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a "What if..." scenario, so that I can explore different possible outcomes of hypothetical situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a "What if..." question THEN the system SHALL accept text input containing the scenario
2. WHEN the input is received THEN the system SHALL validate that the input contains a meaningful scenario
3. IF the input is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to provide a valid "What if..." question

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a serious, realistic analysis of my scenario, so that I can understand the logical consequences and implications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid scenario is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a serious version that follows realistic cause-and-effect logic
2. WHEN generating the serious version THEN the system SHALL consider practical, real-world factors and constraints
3. WHEN the serious analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL present it in a clear, structured format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a fun, creative interpretation of my scenario, so that I can be entertained and see unexpected possibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid scenario is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a fun version that is humorous, exaggerated, or surreal
2. WHEN creating the fun version THEN the system SHALL maintain creativity while avoiding offensive or inappropriate content
3. WHEN the fun analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL present it in an engaging, entertaining format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see both outcomes clearly distinguished, so that I can easily compare the serious and fun interpretations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both versions are generated THEN the system SHALL display them with clear labels distinguishing "Serious Version" and "Fun Version"
2. WHEN presenting the results THEN the system SHALL format the output in a readable, organized manner
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL ensure both versions are easily scannable and comparable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various types of scenarios, so that I can explore different kinds of "What if..." questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing scenarios THEN the system SHALL handle personal, professional, historical, and hypothetical situations
2. WHEN encountering complex scenarios THEN the system SHALL break down the analysis into logical components
3. IF a scenario is too vague THEN the system SHALL request clarification while still attempting to provide meaningful output
