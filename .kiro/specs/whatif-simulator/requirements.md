# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI What If Simulator is a feature that takes user-provided "What if..." questions and generates two distinct alternate outcomes: a realistic, cause-and-effect analysis and a humorous, exaggerated or surreal interpretation. This feature aims to provide both practical insight and entertainment value by exploring scenarios from multiple creative perspectives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a "What if..." scenario, so that I can explore different possible outcomes of hypothetical situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a "What if..." question THEN the system SHALL accept text input containing the scenario
2. WHEN the input is received THEN the system SHALL validate that the input contains a meaningful scenario
3. IF the input is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to provide a valid "What if..." question

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a serious, realistic analysis of my scenario, so that I can understand the logical consequences and implications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid scenario is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a serious version that follows realistic cause-and-effect logic
2. WHEN generating the serious version THEN the system SHALL consider practical, real-world factors and constraints
3. WHEN the serious analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL present it in a clear, structured format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a fun, creative interpretation of my scenario, so that I can be entertained and see unexpected possibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid scenario is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a fun version that is humorous, exaggerated, or surreal
2. WHEN creating the fun version THEN the system SHALL maintain creativity while avoiding offensive or inappropriate content
3. WHEN the fun analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL present it in an engaging, entertaining format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see both outcomes clearly distinguished, so that I can easily compare the serious and fun interpretations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both versions are generated THEN the system SHALL display them with clear labels distinguishing "Serious Version" and "Fun Version"
2. WHEN presenting the results THEN the system SHALL format the output in a readable, organized manner
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL ensure both versions are easily scannable and comparable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want an engaging split-screen interface with animations and interactivity, so that I can have a delightful and entertaining experience while exploring scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a split-screen layout with left panel for serious outcomes and right panel for fun outcomes
2. WHEN results are generated THEN the serious panel SHALL slide in with a calm fade and professional styling
3. WHEN results are generated THEN the fun panel SHALL animate in with playful effects like spinning or wiggling
4. WHEN hovering over panels THEN the system SHALL provide parallax tilt effects for enhanced interactivity
5. WHEN fun results load THEN the system SHALL display emoji confetti or similar celebratory animations
6. WHEN users interact with the input box THEN the system SHALL show animated placeholder text like "What if I skipped gym today?"
7. WHEN users hover over the submit button THEN the system SHALL provide bounce animation feedback
8. WHEN users click submit THEN the button SHALL explode into confetti before processing begins
9. WHEN the system is processing THEN the system SHALL display engaging loading animations like thinking emoji or typing robot
10. WHEN users toggle dark/light mode THEN the system SHALL provide smooth sun-moon morphing animation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various types of scenarios, so that I can explore different kinds of "What if..." questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing scenarios THEN the system SHALL handle personal, professional, historical, and hypothetical situations
2. WHEN encountering complex scenarios THEN the system SHALL break down the analysis into logical components
3. IF a scenario is too vague THEN the system SHALL request clarification while still attempting to provide meaningful output

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to clearly communicate the duality between serious and fun outcomes, so that I understand the contrasting personalities and can be entertained while learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual styling that emphasizes the serious vs fun duality
2. WHEN serious outcomes are shown THEN the system SHALL use professional colors, calm animations, and glowing borders
3. WHEN fun outcomes are shown THEN the system SHALL use vibrant colors, playful animations, and dynamic backgrounds
4. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain the personality distinction through all animations and feedback
5. WHEN judges or users interact with the system THEN the system SHALL be engaging enough to make them laugh while providing value
