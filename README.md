# 🌀 AI What If Simulator
_Category: Games & Entertainment (Interactive Storytelling)_

**One-liner:**  
Turn everyday “What if…” questions into alternate realities.  
Type a decision → get a **serious version** and a **funny, surreal version** in seconds.  

Example:  
- Input: _"What if I skipped gym today?"_  
- Serious: "Skipping gym reduces your consistency and lowers your progress over time."  
- Fun: "The dumbbells form a search party and track you down at the pizza shop."  

## 🚀 Why
Small choices shape our lives. The **What If Simulator** uses AI to instantly generate alternate storylines—serious for reflection, fun for humor. It’s interactive, surprising, and perfect for hackathon demos.  

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React (input box, results, timeline)  
- **Backend**: Node.js API routes  
- **Database**: SQLite (simple story log)  
- **Kiro**: Specs, hooks, and steering for structured outputs  

## ⚡ Demo Flow
1. User enters a “What if…” question in the text box.  
2. Kiro generates:  
   - **Serious version** (realistic consequence).  
   - **Fun version** (playful alternate reality).  
3. Both outputs are shown side by side.  
4. Stories are saved into a **timeline/journal view**.
